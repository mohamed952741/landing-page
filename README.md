## Description

This project takes an HTML file with an unknown number of text sections and performs a couple of functions:

1. Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list according to the number of sections in the page.
2. Each section, when in view, is clearly highlighted by style.
3. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls to the appropriate section smoothly.
4. The list item in the navigation bar is highlighted according to the corresponding section being viewed.

## Notes

- Some of the written code is mostly referenced from the JavaScript documentation of MDN, especially when using the Intersection Observer API and the scrollTo function, but with minimal to almost none copied code and the highest understanding of the topic the Author could manage.
- Some of the HTML and CSS code was altered to accommodate the newly added functions
- This project used HTML,CSS and JS to tie them together.

## Author

The code was written by **Mohamed Ahmed Hussein**, based on starter code given for the project by Udacity.
